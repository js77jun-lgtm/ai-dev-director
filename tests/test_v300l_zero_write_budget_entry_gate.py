"""
v3.0-L ZERO WRITE-BUDGET ENTRY GATE — an ORDER that provably cannot change any file
(max_files_changed == 0 and max_diff_lines == 0, no allowed_deletions) must not be blocked
at ENTRY for AMBIGUOUS_SCOPE just because allowed_paths is empty or whole-repo: the
post-build cap (validate_scope_post_build) already enforces zero changes independently,
so there is nothing for a human to bless. Every other ENTRY gate (HIGH_RISK, protected/
sensitive paths, destructive change) must still fire exactly as before.
